  Click on the User-id link or the pencil icon in the User area on the User and
  Customers Details Form&nbsp; to enter this screen.&nbsp; NetIMEX will not
  allow a user that signed transactions to be deleted so his details will remain
  in the system for the purpose of auditing the signatures, therefore it is also
  possible to disable a user.&nbsp; Check the Disable box on the user profile
  screen to flag the user as disabled.&nbsp; As a result, disabled users will
  not appear in the Supervisor's user maintenance function.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Note: </b>Disabling a user in NetIMEX
  should be performed in parallel to revoking the user's access rights in the
