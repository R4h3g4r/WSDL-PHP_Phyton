<h1><font face="Arial" size="5">ENTITIES</font></h1>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NetIMEX Multi-Entity feature is designed to
allow a Bank using NetIMEX to host the electronic Trade Finance operation of
several Entities in one installation of the system, rather than having several
different installations - one for each entity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The appearance for each Entity created is copied
from an existing Entity.&nbsp; The User creating the entities can select the
Entity from which to copy the appearance of the screens in the new Entity. All
the necessary tables, images, help files and other information required by the
system is automatically copied to the new Entity on its creation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NetIMEX is supplied with one General Bank User
defined. This user can perform only two actions in the system:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Maintain General Bank Users. These users will
    be able to perform these same two functions only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Create new Entities.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A customer User will automatically be logged in
to the Entity to which he belongs, and will be able to view and operate only
those Customers belonging to his group, according to the authorization given to
him. The regular Bank user has the option to edit, create and customize certain
features for his Entity. For further details please refer to the section on Bank
User Work Options with Entities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Customizing Entities</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first screen to which the General Bank User
is routed after login is the Customize Entity screen, where a list of all
Entities is displayed and Entities can be created, edited or deleted.</font><img src="entiti1.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034" width="547" height="282"></p>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If Yes, segregation of duties exists for this
    entity. This means that the authorization of the Banks users are split into
    two types of Bank Users for the entity:</font></li>

    Bank Users as a supervisor or regular Bank user. For regular user the
    Supervisor must set the authorization for specific functions e.g.
