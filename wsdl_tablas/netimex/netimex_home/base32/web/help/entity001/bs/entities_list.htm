<h1><font face="Arial" size="5">ENTITIES</font></h1>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The NetIMEX Multi-Entity feature is designed to
allow a Bank using NetIMEX to host the electronic Trade Finance operation of
several Entities in one installation of the system, rather than having several
different installations - one for each entity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The appearance for each Entity created is copied
from an existing Entity.&nbsp; The User creating the entities can select the
Entity from which to copy the appearance of the screens in the new Entity. All
the necessary tables, images, help files and other information required by the
system is automatically copied to the new Entity on its creation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NetIMEX is supplied with one General Bank User
defined. This user can perform only two actions in the system:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Maintain General Bank Users. These users will
    be able to perform these same two functions only.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Create new Entities.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A customer User will automatically be logged in
to the Entity to which he belongs, and will be able to view and operate only
those Customers belonging to his group, according to the authorization given to
him. The regular Bank user has the option to edit, create and customize certain
features for his Entity. For further details please refer to the section on Bank
User Work Options with Entities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Customizing Entities</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first screen to which the General Bank User
is routed after login is the Customize Entity screen, where a list of all
Entities is displayed and Entities can be created, edited or deleted.</font><img src="entiti1.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034" width="547" height="282"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Entity ID</b> - This is the Entity ID code by
which the Entity is recognized within the system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Entity Description </b>- This is the full name
of the Entity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Limit Bank User Authorization</b> - Allows the
Bank to restrict the authorization of Bank users.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If Yes, segregation of duties exists for this
    entity. This means that the authorization of the Banks users are split into
    two types of Bank Users for the entity:</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Supervisors: Authorized to create other
    Bank Users as a supervisor or regular Bank user. For regular user the
    Supervisor must set the authorization for specific functions e.g.
    authorization maintenance, configuration, audit trail access, translation.
    The supervisor cannot carry out any of these Bank functions and define any
    end Users (None Bank User).&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Bank User. Can work according to the
    authorization set by the supervisor. Cannot create any Bank Users, not as a
    supervisor nor as a regular Bank user and cannot give any regular Bank User
    authorization.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If No, segregation of duties does not exist
    for this entity.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Delete</b> <img src="entiti2.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035" width="22" height="28">&nbsp;-
Clicking on this icon will erase the Entity from the system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Note: </b>An Entity can only be deleted
from the system if there are no regular customers for tlis Entity defined in the
system.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Edit</b> <img src="entiti3.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036" width="26" height="29">-
This function allows the user to make changes&nbsp;to the Entity Description.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img src="entiti4.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037" width="62" height="23">&nbsp;Clicking
on this button allows the user to create a new Entity,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img src="entiti5.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038" width="61" height="22">&nbsp;Returns
the user to the previous screen without making any changes.</font></p>
